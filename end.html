    <h2>End History</h2>
    <p>Around the same time that the nether was being introduced into the game, the 3rd playable realm was being created as well. This was later known to be The End, which is the players endgame of Minecraft. The earliest form of the End was released to the public in 2011.</p>

    <h2>My Color Palette in the End</h2>
    <p>These are colors I tend to pair together when building in the Nether</p>

    <h2><b>My Favorite Nether Blocks</b></h2>
    <h5>1. End Brick</h5>
    <div class="graydiv" align="center" style="background-color: #dfeb78; height:310px;">
    	<img src="endBrick.png", alt="End Brick" style="width:480px; height:270px;" />
    </div>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Reason why:</b></dt>
        <dd>The End is the only place to obtain this block and has very limited use. It only truly matches itself and obsidian. However, when I build in the End, using this block is logifical as no other blocks match the mood and atmosphere as much as this block.</dd>
    </dl>
    <br>
    <h5>2. Obsidian</h5>
    <div class="graydiv" align="center" style="background-color: #280a2e; height:310px;">
      <img src="obsidian.png" alt="Obsidian" style="width:480px; height:270px;" />
    </div>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Reason why:</b></dt>
        <dd>This block is found when fighting the Ender Dragon but can also be found in the Overworld when mixing lava and water together. This block matches End Brick very well and are commonly used together when I build. This block is also used to create Nether portals to get to the nether.</dd>

    <h5>3. Purpur Block</h5>
    <div class="graydiv" align="center" style="background-color: #c189cc; height:310px;">
      <img src="purpur.png" alt="Purpur Block" style="width:480px; height:270px;" />
    </div>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Reason why:</b></dt>
        <dd>Purpur Blocks can only be found in naturally spawning End cities scattered around the world. I do not use this block as much in the End but I use it when building with quartz or birch wood in the Overworld.</dd>
